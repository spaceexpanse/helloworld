/**
 * A processor is a component that computes some stuff and updates to the
 * game SQLite database after the main game-state updates have been done.
 * This could just be hashing the game state for debugging purposes, or it
 * could be computing some caches useful to the frontend.
 *
 * The processing is done in two steps:  First, a read-only snapshot at a
 * well-defined block / game state is given, on which the computations can be
 * performed, and they can take relatively long on a separate processing
 * thread (without holding up the main GSP's block processing).  Second, once
 * the computation is done, the main database is acquired and the result can
 * be written back.  Ideally the processor should use its own database
 * table (that can be set up specifically with SetupSchema) for that.
 *
 * Results of the computation can be accumulated and stored in the processor
 * instance.  The two methods (Compute and Store) will always be called
 * alternatingly, i.e. when Compute is called, it can store the results
 * into member variables, and no second call to Compute will be done until
 * Store has been called (that can access those member variables).
 *
 * Note that processors should be treated as "optional" and "best effort".
 * Their results must not influence the actual consensus game state.
